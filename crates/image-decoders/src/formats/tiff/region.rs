//! Decode a RECTANGLE of a TIFF page instead of the whole thing.
//!
//! The cost of looking at an image should follow the window, not the file. A
//! 10980x10980 band displayed 1:1 in a 1600x1000 window shows about 1.3% of its
//! pixels, and decoding the other 98.7% is work whose only visible effect is
//! the wait before it. Tiled files — which is what every Cloud-Optimized
//! GeoTIFF and whole-slide image is — already store the pixels in independently
//! compressed blocks, so the tiles a viewport covers can be decoded on their
//! own: a handful of blocks whose count depends on the window size, not on how
//! large the image happens to be.
//!
//! This is built on the same `FloatStripPlan` the parallel decoder uses, and on
//! the same `decode_block_rows` that decodes one of its blocks. That is
//! deliberate: a region decode and a whole-image decode that disagreed about a
//! pixel would be a silent correctness bug, and the only real defence is that
//! both walk the same code. The `*_matches_whole_image` tests below assert
//! exactly that, and `test/region-decode-test.js` asserts it again through
//! WebAssembly, across the whole sample corpus.
//!
//! What this does NOT handle, by design — each returns `None`/an error so the
//! caller falls back to the whole-image path rather than getting it wrong:
//!
//! * Layouts the plan itself declines (palette, YCbCr, CFA, sub-byte depths).
//! * `PlanarConfiguration` 2, where one block holds a single channel: assembling
//!   a region from those is a different traversal, and no COG uses it.
//! * `Orientation` other than 1. The stored rows are then not in display order,
//!   so a rectangle in display space is not a rectangle in storage space.
